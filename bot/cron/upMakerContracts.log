06/08/2020 07:55:45 seth-rpc-curl: For example, try running either `parity' or `geth --rpc'.
06/08/2020 07:55:45 seth-rpc-curl: You could also try connecting to an external Ethereum node:
06/08/2020 07:55:45 seth-rpc-curl: For example, try `export ETH_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io'.
06/08/2020 07:55:45 seth-rpc-curl: If you have an Infura API key, add it to the end of the URL.
